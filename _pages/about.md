I'm a Software Engineer who started writing code with Java before the effect 2000. I have experience in different roles in the IT world (_'guy-for-everything'_, developer, team lead, project manager and CTO) working in companies in many sectors: energy, e-commerce, startups (some unicorn), technology consultancy companies and application performance monitoring.

Always concerned with questions like "how does it work?" and "how can we make it better?", I love to share my knowledge with others and at the same time learn from others. As a natural progression to my attitude, I founded the [Barcelona Java Users Group](https://www.barcelonajug.org) in 2011 and later I co-founded the non-profit association with the same name. In 2015 I founded the [Java and JVM Barcelona Conference (JBCNConf)](https://www.jbcnconf.com) which became the reference conference for Java developers in southern Europe with more than 740 attendees in 2019.

When I'm not thinking in the next interesting thing to do for the community, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing sports or improving my TDD and eXtreme Programming skills.
