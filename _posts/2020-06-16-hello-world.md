I've been thinking about the option of creating a blog (again) for some time now, and once again I've thought, I'm going to give it a try. I hope this time I can be a little more constant than in my past ðŸ˜‰ And how should I start? What does a developer normally start with? Yes, you probably may guess it:

```
Hello world!
```

There are probably no two words more recognized in the software development industry than these two ðŸ˜‰

As many of you may know, it is common practice to learn a programming language using these 2 famous words, printing in a simple program. But, do you know why `"Hello, World!"` and not other words?

As it appears [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), the tradition of using this phrase as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book _The C Programming Language_ (you remember this great book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, right?). The example program in that book prints `"hello, world"`, and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, _Programming in C: A Tutorial_.

You know, everything has an start.

Now it is done! Let's see how it goes ðŸ˜ƒ
